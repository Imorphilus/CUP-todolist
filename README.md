# CUP-todolist
A mobile app to help prioritise daily tasks

Here is a simple tool to set daily priorities, called CUP. The idea is that by adding a score of how urgent something feels to a score of how important for the long term and adding those scores together to get an overall priority, you drive yourself towards longer term more important jobs rather than just falling into the trap of doing the urgent little tasks.

With the help of Claude AI this is now a simple app that you can have on your phone. There are no bells and whistles / pretty fonts etc but if you like the idea we can embellish over time based on your feedback.

I hope you give it a try and please send your feedback to admin@morphilus.com.au after perhaps a week of use.

Since it is called CUP, the recommendation is to get your phone out when you have your first CUP of coffee of the day, and update your task list to see what is judged number 1, 2 or 3 on the list. This is not precise so your gut feel will be the final judge.

## USER INSTRUCTIONS

### VERY IMPORTANT Notes About Data Storage

- The CUP app stores your data locally on each specific device and browser
- Your tasks on your phone won't appear on your computer (and vice versa)
- Always use the same browser on the same device to see your tasks
- Adding the app to your home screen (on mobile) helps ensure you're using the same browser instance each time

**From experience: Make sure you set it up on your home screen and check that it is saving your tasks before you go loading up a lot of tasks.**

If you find the app doesn't remember you or your tasks:
- Make sure you're using the same browser each time
- Try adding it to your home screen as described above
- Avoid using private/incognito browsing modes which clear data when closed

These steps should help you access your CUP app more easily and ensure it remembers your user profile and tasks!

### Getting Started

1. Per the above: Access the app from your home screen
2. Create your profile by clicking "+ Add New User"
3. Enter your name and click "Save User"
4. Click on your name to see your list

### Understanding CUP Scoring

- **C Score (Currently Important)**: (1-10) How urgent is this task? Some users relate this to a time factor eg must do it today = 10 Can wait till tomorrow = 8
- **U Score (Ultimate Important)**: (1-10) How important is this for the long term? eg booking a car service = 8 while booking a restaurant = 4
- **P Score**: Automatically calculated as C+U to give you the overall Priority. The list is automatically sorted.

For more detailed help on scoring, click the "?" help button in the top right corner of the app.

### Adding Tasks

1. Click "+ Add New Task"
2. Enter a description of what needs to be done
3. Score it from 1-10 for Current importance (urgency)
4. Score it from 1-10 for Ultimate importance (long-term value)
5. Select a category (Work, Kids, Home, etc.)
6. Click "Save Task"

### Managing Your Day

- Tasks are automatically sorted by Priority (highest first)
- When you complete a task, click "Finish"
- If you decide not to do a task, click "Drop"
- Need to make changes? Click "Edit"
- Filter tasks by category using the dropdown

### Tips

- Check your list during your morning coffee. Add new tasks, click finish if a task is done, and adjust scores as needed. Drop a task if it is now not necessary.
- Focus on the highest priority tasks first
- Review completed tasks occasionally to see your progress
- Use the different categories to organize work/home/personal tasks
- Use the help button (?) if you need guidance on how to score tasks

## Note

This app stores data locally on your device, so tasks you create on your phone won't appear on your computer and vice versa. Each device will have its own separate list. (So just choose to use one device)

No doubt you will need to spend a few minutes doing the first fill of your todo list. But once done on each subsequent day, adding a few and indicating completed on others should be easily done during the time it takes to drink a coffee.

We look forward to your feedback after you've had a chance to use it! Don't hesitate to contact us if you have difficulty setting it up. Make sure you set it up on your home screen and check that it is saving your tasks before you go loading up a lot of tasks.

Good Luck
